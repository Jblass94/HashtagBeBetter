# HashtagBeBetter
First off, I would like to thank you for stopping by.
Just learning to start coding and to see where this journey will help our company improve.
I've always been interested in coding and computers.
I am always looking for ways to exercise my brain and this seems to be a very difficult thing to do.
I enjoy helping people and bringing a light to other people's lives.
My team enjoys building a thriving community!
People always need others to lean on and we would love to be that for you, if you so need it.
We understand that life may not always be easy...
That is why we want to help shine a light on the fact that just because someone makes everything seem ok... 
Often times, its not really as ok as it may seem.
Some of my hobbies include gaming, learning, experiencing, travelling, reading, meeting new people, hearing other people's life experiences, and helping others.
Maybe one day the world will be a better place and we will all be able to live in peace.
Until then, we need a few more people that are interested in learning from other people's mistakes rather than making their own.
I'm not saying making mistakes is bad. That is, in fact, the best way to learn. What I am trying to say is, we could make fewer mistakes in this world if we communicated with one another a little more efficiently.
Maybe, don't immediately shut someone else down when they have a different opinion than your own... Anyways, if you're interested in any of the things I stated prior to this, feel free to reach out through Twitter or our website and we would love to talk.

Thanks,

Joe with HASHTAGBEBETTER, LLC.

It has been my pleasure.
